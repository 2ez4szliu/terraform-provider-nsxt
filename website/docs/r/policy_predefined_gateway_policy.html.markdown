# nsxt_policy_predefined_gateway_policy

This resource provides a method to fine-tune a pre-created Gateway Policy and its rules.
There are two separate use cases for this resource:
* Modify certain settings of default Gateway Policy and its Default Rule.
* Modify predefined Gateway Policy that is not listed under Default category, and add rules to it.
  This use case is relevant for VMC.

This resource is applicable to NSX Global Manager, NSX Policy Manager and VMC.

## Example Usage for NSX Policy Manager

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_predefined_gateway_policy" "test" {
  path = "/infra/domains/default/gateway-policies/Policy_Default_Infra"

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "orange"
  }

  default_rule {
    scope     = nsxt_policy_tier0_gateway.main.path
    logged    = true
    log_label = "orange default"
    action  = "ALLOW"
  }

}
```

## Example Usage for VMC

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_predefined_gateway_policy" "test" {
  path = "/infra/domains/cgw/gateway-policies/default"

  rule {
    display_name  = "Allow ICMP"
    services      = [nsxt_policy_service.icmp.path]
    source_groups = [nsxt_policy_group.green.path]
    logged        = true
    log_label     = "icmp"
    action        = "ALLOW"
  }
}
```
